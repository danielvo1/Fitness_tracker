# Fitness Tracker
Tasked to complete this fitness tracker application. The code came with front-end code, and my job was to complete the applications back-end which comprised of creating routes, models for the database, and creating the connection between front and back end.

## Getting Started
​I started by first cloning down the starter code, and doing an npm install. I first tackled the server connection, then I created the html routes, then the api routes, and finally made alterations to make the application deployable. In addition, throughout the process I used insomnia to check my routes. And make adjustments accordingly.
